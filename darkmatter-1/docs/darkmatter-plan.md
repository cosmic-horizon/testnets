## NOTE:
Cosmic Horizon Network is committed to building a strong community. We would like to extend our thanks to our early adapters & supporters and they are given priority over new participants wherever there's a tie. Here are a possible cases (but not limited to) where we extend our support and prioritize early community members (our partners, core validators and investors)
- Allocate 10% extra tokens on genesis (gentxs)
- Ranking boost (whenever there's a tie)

For the avoidance of doubt, a _missed_ block, is a block for which the validator's signature is omitted from the finalised block, regardless of reason. Logs from a validator showing a signature was broadcast does not constitute inclusion of the signature in the finalised block.

## Code Of Conduct

- Testnet tokens are limited and valuable assets for the testnet. It is restricted/not allowed to receive external delegations. One should not try to increase their voting power by spamming the faucet. But it is encouraged to increase their stake by re-staking their rewards.  There are no incentives related to the number of tokens you attain.  The faucet should be used as a utility.  
- We expect formal and professional behaviour from the participants and encourage a healthy competition, as well as healthy cooperation. Any misbehaviour will potentially disqualify one from the contest. This includes trolling channels, and being dismissive or rude to teammembers or other testnet participants.  
- Participating as a group or running validators from multiple accounts should be strictly avoided and any hint on such activities would disqualify users staraight away. Everyone involved would get ZERO rewards. We are not running this testnet to uncover cartel behavior, there are testnets where that is perfectly acceptable and encouraged, find those testnets. This testnet is explicitly to test Cosmic Horizon functionality and performance and create an opportunity for helping to secure and govern our network.  This is not an adversarial testnet in which the basic assumptions of PoS systems are being tested. Don't encourage your friends to spin up nodes just for the rewards sake.
- If a user is flagged or blocked on Discord/Github/Twitter will be considered ineligible. 
- Same account/name should be used throughout the testnet. It's not allowed to raise PRs from different github accounts.
